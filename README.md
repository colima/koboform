KoBoForm
========

KoBoForm was developed by researchers for creating data collection forms that can be used in KoBoCollect and ODKCollect, as well as similar tools. 

You can use this tool online without having to install it: http://www.kobotoolbox.org/koboform

We are currently building a new version of KoBoForm that will supersede this project. We are not actively developing this version of KoBoForm as a result.
